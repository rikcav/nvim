# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration files.
Neovim is a highly customizable text editor that inherits the powerful editing
capabilities of Vim while adding modern features like built-in terminal support
and a more user-friendly configuration format.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rikcav/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. Install the required plugins:

   Open Neovim, go to `lua/plugins.lua` and save the file.
   It will automatically install the plugins.

3. Restart Neovim for the changes to take effect.
